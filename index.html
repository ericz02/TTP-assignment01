        <h1 class="title">Environment Conservation</h1>

        <p class="description">Environmental conservation refers to the practice of protecting and preserving the
            natural
            environment and its resources. It involves the sustainable use of natural resources while minimizing
            negative
            impacts on ecosystems, biodiversity, and the overall health of the planet. The goal of environmental
            conservation
            is to maintain ecological balance, prevent the depletion of natural resources, and ensure the long-term
            well-being
            of both present and future generations.
